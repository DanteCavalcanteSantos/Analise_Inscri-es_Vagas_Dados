# Detailed Analysis of the Application Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Objective

This project is an analysis of my applications for data jobs at national and international companies.

The purpose of the analysis is to visualize the lack of feedback and rejections from hiring companies. It also aims to criticize the job market for trans people, which tends to underestimate them for entry-level positions.

This project also compares my competencies based on the soft and hard skills required in the job openings.

I'm not applying for a job, but rather sharing my perspective on the data job market, in which I have extensive experience.

Regarding the dashboard alignment, it's not 100% accurate, as I preferred to focus more on the dashboard content than the visuals.

I'm a professional in constant learning, striving to achieve my dreams and become a leading figure in the market.

I'm available for any job in the data field and I'm also available to freelancers.

## Analysis of the Application Monitoring Dashboard.

### KPIs

I created 5 KPIs for visualization:

- Total Number of Jobs Applied
- Average Response Time
- Total Number of Rejected Applications
- % Responded
- % Not Provided a Response

- Total Number of Jobs Applied

Over the course of 3 months, 158 job applications were submitted.

- Average Response Time

The average response time from companies was 2 days, considering only those that provided some type of feedback—whether automatic or personalized—on the progress of the selection process. Although this timeframe is relatively short, it is important to note that many companies did not provide any response.

- Total Number of Rejected Applications
Of the applications that received a response, 62 resulted in rejection, representing 39.2% of the total number of job applications.

- % Responded

Only 40.5% of companies provided any kind of response. While this is a significant number, the majority of these responses were negative.

- % Did not respond

Approximately 59.5% of companies did not respond with any information, demonstrating a lack of commitment to candidates and transparency in the selection process.

### Job Application Count

During my job search, I prioritized positions that aligned with my experience and where I felt most comfortable. However, I didn't limit myself to the data world alone—I also explored opportunities in different areas, expanding my field of expertise.

The graph shows that my main focus was on Junior Data Analyst positions, with 78 applications, representing 49% of the total—almost half of the applications. In this role, I have the autonomy to solve problems independently, in addition to collaborating with other analysts on the team. It's frustrating to realize that, despite my experience, I haven't yet had the opportunity to work directly in this area.

The second most sought-after category was Junior BI Analyst, with 48 applications, representing 30% of the total. I have proven experience in Business Intelligence, as well as additional training through specific courses.

In third place are the so-called Similar Positions, with 11 applications (7%). These openings are related to the data world and include roles I've held in the past, such as Project Analyst, Quality Analyst, IT Administrative Assistant, Network and Data Communications Analyst, and Junior Support Analyst.

Finally, I also applied for a few Specialist and Senior-level positions as a way to test my skills for greater challenges. While I don't yet have advanced experience for these positions, I emphasize that I'm open to growth and taking on more complex responsibilities.

### Employment Modality

During my search for a new relocation opportunity, one of the factors I considered was the type of contract offered. I prioritized positions under the CLT (Consolidated Labor Laws) regime due to the benefits and legal guarantees this model provides, such as paid vacation, health insurance, 13th-month salary, and FGTS (FGTS).

Of the 158 positions I applied for, 138 (87%) were for CLT (Consolidated Labor Laws) contracts. However, I also applied to 9 positions (6%) under the Legal Entity (PJ) model. The low number of applications under this format is partly due to specific company requirements and the perception that the PJ regime can be used to reduce costs, often at the expense of basic rights—such as vacation time, healthcare, and contractual stability.

Despite this, I am reevaluating my strategy and am considering expanding my work as a PJ. This model allows for greater flexibility, the ability to serve multiple clients, and, consequently, build a more diversified and stable portfolio. From this perspective, the PJ model can be advantageous.

I believe some of the rejections may be related to the requested salary range. According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.br/Sal%C3%A1rios/analista-de-dados-junior-sal%C3%A1rio-SRCH_KO0,24.htm), the salary for a Junior Data Analyst ranges from R$3,000.00 to R$5,000.00. Currently, I'm requesting R$3,500.00, which I consider fair considering my experience and training.

For PJ positions, I expect up to R$6,000.00, considering that this amount needs to cover expenses that would normally be covered by the company under a CLT contract—such as health insurance, meals, and a financial reserve for periods without a contract.

Some vacancies did not indicate the type of contract at the time of application or were registered before this criterion was defined in the project, which created gaps in the analysis.

### Applied Platforms

Digital platforms play a fundamental role for both candidates seeking job opportunities and recruiters, who use automated systems to filter resumes that match job openings. However, these systems—known as ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)—are often cited as one of the biggest challenges in the application process, especially by professionals who struggle to overcome their automated barriers.

In the Applied Platforms chart, LinkedIn stands out, where I submitted 85 applications (54%), representing more than half of all applications. It's the platform I use most, both for searching for jobs and for publicizing my projects and professional trajectory. Among its main advantages are:

- Easier job search

- Simplified application, using your pre-uploaded resume

- Clear visualization of the skills required by employers

- Monitoring of companies of interest

- Connection with leading professionals, which contributes to my development in the data market

On the other hand, LinkedIn still has limitations, such as the lack of feedback from companies and the lack of detailed monitoring of the selection processes.

The second most used platform was Gupy, with 43 applications (27%). Although considered challenging by many candidates due to its rigorous ATS, I find the platform functional and even intuitive. One positive point is the visualization of the selection process stages, which provides greater transparency. However, many companies include several stages and still fail to review the resumes. I've tried adjusting my resume to improve its performance in Gupy's filters, but without success so far.

In third place is Catho, with 10 applications (6%). Catho and Infojobs belong to the same group and share the same system. For the positions I applied for through them, the only feedback I received was recruiters viewing my resume—without any concrete responses. Therefore, I don't see any benefit in using Catho's paid services, as the free version didn't yield significant results. I opted to invest in LinkedIn Premium, which offers more features and visibility for applications.

Currently, I continue to prioritize LinkedIn as my primary search platform, especially since the best opportunities I've had to date have come through it.

### Work Model

The post-pandemic work model has brought significant gains in quality of life for many professionals. I am an example of this: I constantly search for remote positions because I value flexibility and work-life balance. However, given the reality of unemployment and financial pressure, it is often necessary to consider other modalities, such as hybrid or in-person work.

The hybrid format is currently the most common in the data field, which is reflected in the graph: there were 57 applications (36%). The remote model, which is my preference, represented 46 applications (29%). Most remote positions are offered by international companies, while many national organizations have opted for the hybrid model.

The N/A category was the most significant in the graph, with 30 applications (19%). This is due to the fact that many companies do not disclose the work modality at the time of application. Furthermore, some of these vacancies were registered before this criterion was defined in the analysis project, which also contributed to this gap.

Finally, the in-person model was the least sought after, with 25 applications (16%). This choice is directly related to quality of life. Most in-person positions are not located near the North Zone, where I live, which would imply long daily commutes. This factor directly impacts my well-being and productivity, making the in-person model less attractive.

### Application Status

The Application Status chart highlights a worrying reality: the low rate of continuation in companies' selection processes. To illustrate, I mention the only position for which I am still officially in the process—when checking the link to the posting, I noticed that it has already been removed, and since August 14, 2025, I have not received any further response from the recruiter. This lack of communication is frustrating, especially considering that my resume aligns with many of the positions I applied to—as will be detailed in the competency analyses.

My commitment to returning to the data field has been intense. I submitted 93 applications (59%), demonstrating dedication and consistency. On the other hand, 62 of them (39%) resulted in rejection, most automatically, without any feedback. Only two positions were canceled by the companies.

These numbers reflect the reality of many junior professionals seeking to re-enter the job market: high competition, automated selection processes, and little transparency. Still, I remain committed to my development and open to new strategies to gain opportunities in this field.

### Competency Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to compare my competencies with the most common requirements in the positions I applied to. To do this, I collected information from the "Requirements and Qualifications" section found in most job descriptions. I did not include all positions because many links had already been removed, and for this analysis, a representative sample was sufficient.
I used Python to perform the analysis, applying absolute frequency calculations to identify the most frequently mentioned terms in the descriptions. The libraries used were:
- Pandas: for manipulating data extracted from an .xlsx file
- Collections (Counter): for counting word frequency
- re (Regular Expressions): for cleaning and standardizing strings
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): for removing prepositions, conjunctions, and stopwords

#### Most Frequent Keywords

The five most frequently used words in the job descriptions were:
- Data — Appeared 81 times. It reflects the centrality of data in the decision-making process. As a data scientist/analyst, mastery of collection, processing, and interpretation is essential. I constantly update myself on techniques and tools to improve my performance.
- Experience — Appeared 37 times. Although a common requirement, it is also a barrier for professionals seeking new jobs. Without opportunities, there is no way to acquire the required experience.
- Power — Appeared 26 times. Refers to Power BI, one of the most sought-after visualization tools on the market. The demand for proficiency in this platform is high.
- SQL — Appeared 26 times. Essential for data manipulation and dashboard building. I continue to study SQL to ensure quality in the delivery of analyses and improve the accuracy of predictive models.
- Knowledge — Appeared 24 times. Although a more abstract term, it represents an important criterion in evaluating candidates. I classified myself as advanced, considering not only technical proficiency but also my practical experience in the market. The word BI, which appears immediately after these five, also deserves attention. It can refer to both Business Intelligence practices and the Power BI tool itself, reinforcing the importance of this skill set in the job openings analyzed.

#### Skills Classification

Based on the most frequently used words, I classified my proficiency level into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Of the top five, only one is at the intermediate level—reflecting the difficulty of gaining practical experience without real-world opportunities. This gap is one of the main challenges faced by professionals starting or resuming their careers.

If you'd like, I can help you transform this analysis into a visual presentation or cross-reference this data with the types of jobs and platforms used. Just let me know!

## Conclusions

The main intention of this project is to highlight how challenging and exhausting it can be for an experienced professional—even at a junior level—to return to the job market. Recruitment platforms need to evolve their automated screening systems (ATS) to offer a more humanized analysis that considers the candidate's potential beyond keywords.
Furthermore, it is essential that the technology sector promotes quality of life. Unlike other fields, working in tech does not require constant physical presence, and the remote model should be more valued by national companies.
I also express my condemnation of the abusive practices of companies that use the Legal Entity hiring system to offer low salaries and demand excessive working hours, without due recognition or benefits. This approach makes work precarious and devalues ​​professionals.

Recruitment teams urgently need to review their practices, adopting more transparent, respectful, and human-centered selection processes. It is unacceptable that so many companies treat candidates with disregard, ignoring the effort and dedication involved in each application.

I continue to update my database and continually improve myself—not just to secure a position, but to demonstrate to these companies that I am a competent, committed professional, prepared to contribute with excellence.
I remain open to new opportunities, both in national and international companies, always focusing on the data field and building a solid and ethical career.
